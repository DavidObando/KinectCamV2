# KinectCamV2
Original code is from Piotr Sowa (http://codingbytodesign.net/2014/07/20/kinectcamv2-for-kinect-v2/)

The code is functional with Kinect for Xbox One and the v2 SDK, but it hasn't been sanitized as of this commit. However, the project has been cleaned to not mess with your file system.

Also, make sure you enable Windows Hello with your Kinect. It works perfectly! https://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/kinect/Windows-Hello-with-the-Kinect-v2
